# CodeX Tetris

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game built with [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).

## Getting started

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python -m game.tetris
   ```

## Gameplay

* Move the falling tetromino with the left and right arrow keys.
* Rotate the piece with the up arrow key.
* Soft drop using the down arrow key.
* Hard drop using the space bar.
* Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to exit the game.

Clearing lines increases your score and gradually speeds up the game. Have fun stacking!
